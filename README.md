# **Q1.Assembly Language Programming**

Definition: In this question, you are asked to implement an assembly application in RISC-V ISA. Your application first asks a positive integer value; N, from the console. Then, it prints a NxN right triangle to the screen by using * s. For input 7, your output should be as in the example:

   \* 

   \* * 

   \* * * 

   \* * * * 

   \* * * * * 

   \* * * * * * 

   \* * * * * * *

# **Q2.Assembly Language, Programming a Recursive Method**

Definition: In this question, you are asked to implement a recursive code assembly in RISC-V ISA. 

Your application should ask an N value from the console. Then it calculates the F(N) according to the given definition of f(x).

â€‹                     F(x) = ![img](file:///C:\Users\EXCALI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml27168\wps1.jpg)

# **Q3.Assembly Language, Programming with Arrays** 

Definition: In this question, you are asked to implement an assembly code in RISC-V, which operates on arrays.

Your application first asks an integer value for the number of elements in an array. Then, that many times it gets an integer value from the console for the elements of the array. Then it sorts the array and prints the sorted array to the screen.  

Example: 

Size of the array?: 5

1: 13

2: 25

3: 2

4: 17

5: 21

Your sorted array is: 2 13 17 21 25
